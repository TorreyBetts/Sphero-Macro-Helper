/*!
The SpheroMacroHelper class was created to simplify the use of macros that are provided by the Sphero SDK.

When using the Sphero SDK macro classes require several lines of code to define the macro for execution.

    RKMacroObject *macro = [RKMacroObject new];
    [macro addCommand:[RKMCLoopFor commandWithRepeats:2]];
    [SpheroMacroHelper rotateUsingMacro:macro rotation:180 delay:500];
    [macro addCommand:[RKMCDelay commandWithDelay:500]];
    [macro addCommand:[RKMCLoopEnd command]];
    RKMacroPlayer *player = [[RKMacroPlayer alloc] initWithRobot:_robot.robot];
    [player play:macro];

To simplify macro creation and give it a more iOS feel like when working with UIView animations, macro commands are added into a command block and are executed first with an option to repeat after completion. Once commands are executed a second set of commands can also be executed.

    [SpheroMacroHelper performCommandsUsingRobot:_robot timesToRepeat:1 autoplay:YES commands:^(RKMacroObject *macro)
    {
        [SpheroMacroHelper rotateUsingMacro:macro rotation:180 delay:500];
    } completion:nil];
